A system of journaling that will help you align today's actions with tomorrow's ambitions

## Introduction

  Oftentimes, I find myself lacking a sense of purpose. Perhaps the reason for this is that I find it hard to see how short term tasks have any meaning in relation to my long terms goals. How will washing the dishes today help me form a start up business in the future? How will scheduling that dentist appointment help me become a more charitable person? How will taking out the trash help me achieve a career I can be passionate about?

It may seem absurd to ask these questions, but it brings up an interesting point. We think in terms of the larger-than-life questions—our dreams, our aspirations, our search for meaning and purpose—but we are constrained by short term decision making. For the average person, its very hard to see how the trivial tasks you have to accomplish in the short term translate to the big changes you want to see in your life. And this often results in that cloudy state of mind that is 'indecision.' Is what I'm doing right now really worth it, or should I just stop and find something better to do? Its hard to tell when you can't really seem to measure how much you are gaining from any of these tasks. Because of this, we often make decisions half-heartedly or fail to decide anything at all.

In many ways, we live life like we browse through Netflix, trying to decide what to watch. You have ideas of what you want to feel—perhaps you want to be creeped out, or you want to laugh, or cry, or some combination of these. You look at the large selection of movies, and they all seem okay, but none seem to be exactly what you want. Maybe you choose one, but of course, Netflix has virtually infinite scrolling, so you think to yourself, "Maybe I could find something better." The problem is, many times you don't. You keep scrolling in search of something better, and before you know it, you're too tired to stay up for a movie, and you end up watching nothing.

That part of our thinking, the voice that says "Maybe you could do something better," is a double edged sword. It is the part that drives us to keep searching for new ideas and prevents us from becoming complacent, but for many, myself included, it also makes it very difficult to commit to anything I do. It makes me flakey, prone to procrastination, constantly distracted and terminally unsatisfied. When presented with a choice, because I understand very little of the long term effects of each choice, I resort to going with what I know instead—the short term gratification of it.

How many times have you been working on an assignment or project when suddenly, the urge to check your Facebook or Instagram appears? Or perhaps a completely unrelated question or thought pops in your head and you feel the need to search for it online? If you were to keep satisfying these fleeting impulses, as many of us do, you would find it near impossible to commit to your work. These impulses are preventing you from accomplishing that larger task.

Similarly, and in a larger sense, A life led by short term gratification can go in very different directions than one focused on long term goals. What feels good in the moment is not always what is best in the long run. If you want to go on a diet so that you look and feel healthier months down the road, then you must resist the short term impulse of eating that chocolate cake in the fridge, despite the fact that it would feel damn good to eat then and there. Day to day, we face too many of these decision problems, where we need the willpower to not feed short term impulses because of how they conflict with long term goals. But how did we get to this point where we have so many short term impulses that take us away from what we are really trying to accomplish? And better yet, what if we could tip the scale towards having more short term impulses that actually further our long term goals?

In this question lies the motivation for this project. Many systems already exist to tackle the problem of momentary disorganization. We have todo lists, calendars, Bullet Journals, and many more which try to tackle at least the problem of keeping all your responsibilities in check. However, where these tools fall short is when thinking of long term growth. Sure, your day to day tasks are in order, and you can keep track of responsibilities in the future as well. But this does nothing other than show you what you have to do at any given time, but not how these things connect and certainly not how these things contribute to what your long term goals are. You may have to go to a dentist appointment now or submit that report 3 months from now, but you can't see where these things fall in the grand scheme of things.

Thats where my system comes into play, and where I feel it outshines others. It makes you not only think of longer term goals, but map those layer by layer into day to day tasks, such that simply adding these tasks to your daily routine will bring you incrementally closer to that long term goal that, up until now, you've only been thinking about. You can turn your larger plans into what they ultimately always come down to—small trivial choices and tasks.

## The Setup

The Atomic Journaling System works best with two notebooks, one for your daily and weekly goal-setting and the other for your larger goal-setting intervals. However, you can get by with one notebook split into two sections

### RULES
Each Goal Unit must be POSSIBLE
->you must currently have or be able to acquire within the appropriate time
 frame all the resources necessary to accomplish it
->The time frame of each Goal Unit must be less than or equal to its
 category (1 day for daily tasks, 1 week for weekly checkpoints, etc.)
Each Goal Unit must be PRECISE
->That means that it can be broken down into trivial steps
Each Goal Unit must be CONCISE
->They must be able to be done in a reasonable amount of steps
->if it takes too many steps to complete one goal, it must be broken into
 multiple goals
Each Goal Unit must have TANGIBLE RESULTS
->you must be able to show that something was done


## What I Hope You'll Gain
This system is designed to accomplish several things. First and foremost, it will aid in aligning short term goals to long term goals. It forces you to think of your long term goals alongside your short term ones, and see whether what you are doing day to day really benefits you week to week, month to month, and longer. is really benefiting you in terms of long term growth. In the end, regardless of how you define personal growth, change will always come down to the trivial things we do, things that cannot be broken down into other things and are rather meaningless in and of themselves, but have significance collectively.

Second, it forces you to be mindful of what you are doing day to day. It makes you map your long term goals to actual trivial tasks and decisions you make. You can see clearly that your dreams and ambitions aren't the monsters they seem to be, that they can become tangibly achieved by being converted into tangible actions.

Lastly, it transforms your thinking to mold to an incentive system that is focused on task completion, which will increase your productivity, and make you less likely to be distracted by momentary impulses.
